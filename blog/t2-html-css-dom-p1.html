            <h4> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4>
            <p>
              I like the analogy of the body. In this model the body (website) is made up of: the organs (except for skin) of a website. The content and structure are contained here; the hair, eye colour and features of a website. The style of the website is contained here; and the skin and bones of a website. The configuration of the organs and features are decided by how DOM places the bones and skin.
            <h4> What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
            <p>
              It means figuring out how the design mock up translates to the components of website structure (HTML elements e.g. text or images).
              Every element on a page is inside a box.
            </p>
            <h4>What is the box model?</h4>
            <p>
              The box model is the layers of an element that help position different elements on a page.
              The box is made up of four parts which are:<em>the element itself</em> - the innermost layer;<em>padding</em> - the space between the element and a border (if used);<em>the border</em> - this can wrap an element with a border in various styles/thickness such as dashes or solid lines; and <em>the margin</em> - the space between the border and other boxed elements.
              These four parts can be added together to give the total dimensions of a boxed element.
