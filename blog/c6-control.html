            <h4> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
            <p>
              When programming some of my triggers are: not understanding the instructions; going over the expected time limit for a task; and making simple mistakes that hold up the whole code suck as forgetting to place brackets and semi colons correctly.
              In terms of a disproportionate emotional response is probably when a task goes overtime - I go into quite a funk and usually can only return to the task the next day.

            <h4>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
            <p>
              I found it a fantastic mmemonic device and a really good way to use emotions as a friend rather than as a boss or foe.
              Instead of trying to follow their dictates or ignore them actually listening to them with a compassionate and open ear means they can teach you rather than rule you.
              I recently lost my temper and swore at a family member when they were probing me about something I am insecure about.
              By meditating about the situation using the Siberain Railroad method meant that I could try see their  perspective and work on a kinder response for the next time I am goaded by them.
