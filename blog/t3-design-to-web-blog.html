            <h4> What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h4>
            <p>
              A responsive site is one which adjusts according to the media device being used.
              This is important as devices are all different sizes and layouts.
              By making a site responsive it helps ensure the site is still user-friendly no matter whether the user is reading the content off a phone, desktop or tablet.
            </p>
            <h4>
             What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h4>
            <p>
              Mobile first design is an approach to website development which mandates that sites are built for mobile devices first before other layouts are considered.
              It is important because mobile first design means that sites are configured for the most commonly used viewing device first.
            </p>
            <h4>  What frameworks are, and their pros and cons? </h4>
            <p>
              Frameworks are collections of code that have functionality most developers wish to use such as grid layouts and buttons.
              Examples of frameworks include Bootstrap and Skeleton.
              Their main pro is their efficiency (if you want to use certain features without setting up all the styling coding you can).
              Main cons are that they are often difficult to adjust if you want to style core features like tables and buttons differently and they mean you often need more skill rather than less to successfully use (not so helpful for a beginner like me IMO).

            <h4>  What a wireframe is and why we use it?</h4>
            <p>
              A wireframe is a way to plan the layout of a site using the box model.
              Below is an example of a wireframe I did to redesign this site.

            <h4> The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why? </h4>
            <p>
              I found it incredibly difficult to use media queries to change the orientation and size of elements such as text and images.
              To be honest I would have found it easier without having to use the skeleton framework.
