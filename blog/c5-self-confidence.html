            <h4> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
            <p>
              The relationship is that mindfulness can lead to greater self-awareness and more accurate self-assessments because you are exercising meta-subjective-objectivity to feel and think while giving yourself internal space within yourself.
              Without self-awareness and accurate self-assessment we are not likely to see ourselves as we are, both the good and the bad. These self-assessments help you to feel pride and competent in the things that you are skilled at.
            </p>
            <h4>  Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel? </h4>
            <p>
              I tried the body-scan activity.
              Since reading this book I have been doing this (without knowing the official name for it) when I have felt myself to be upset.
              My experience of it this week was really telling as it has been a week of grief and confrontation.
              I could feel that I had a slight tension headache and that my back and knees were stiff and aching.
              These bodily phenomena were related to my emotional state.
              I have been feeling sad, tense, worried and anxious this week - none of these being particularly great feelings to hold onto.
              After this activity I made a conscious effort to stay busy and social because I needed to have other positive things to think about.
              So I hung out with positive family members, limited time with difficult family members and did things that make me feel good like going for walks at the beach and in the bush, going to an open mic night and drinking coffee with my boyfriend at all my favourite cafes in the hutt valley.

            <h4> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section? </h4>
            <p>
              Emotions shift from existenital to experiential.
              I thought this really encapsulated the core of what mindfulness can do for your emotional awareness.
              I think emotions are really good cues that something in our environment is either triggering or enhancing.
              This realisation gives you more agency - you feel like you can use emotions as a reference point rather than the whole map for your actions, especially in times of stress.
