      <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
      <p>
        Grid based design is when the webpage is seperated into rows and columns (usually 12 columns of equal size).
        This allows front-end developers to easily lay out content in a clean and visually-appealing way.
      </p>
      <h4>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
      <p>
        The hype is that responsiveness makes your website work (in terms of design) on multiple devices (e.g.phone/tablet/large PC screen/laptop).
        Responsiveness ensures that structural elements such as columns change in size depending on the resolution of device screens e.g. shrinking the webpage from a PC screen to fit a smartphone screen.
      </p>
      <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>
      <p>
        Semantic structure is when elements such as headings or paragraphs are used to provide additional structure to content.
        This is because people tend to prefer using different sizing/weight of font to provide more/less emphasis or importance to content.
        For example, in the heirarchy of text h1 tends to be larger and more important than body text found in a paragraph.

      <h4>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h4>

        I also watched the bootstrapping lesson which was useful and I think I may use some of the functionality like modals in future sites.
        In terms of lesson 2 I found it way more useful to me (as I read lots of orientation 'head-start' material about CSS and HTML before coming).
        The head start material glossed over grids and placeholders which this lesson went into more depth about.
        I also found the material about media queries really relevant too.
