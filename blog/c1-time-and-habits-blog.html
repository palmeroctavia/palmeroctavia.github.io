      <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
      <p>
        The timebox and habits techniques I tried were using toggle and the pomodoro technique.
        I also really liked the resource about counterintuitive ways to be productive.
        I am very much a 'seasons' person - I have had times of great productivity but then I have needed to take time out to reboot.
        In saying that I am organised and committed - necessity is often a great motivator.
        Knowing I have a heap of work due helps me stay productive.
        I also use a series of planning notepads that I refresh on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.
      </p>
      <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
      <p>
        I found the pomodoro technique interesting. 25 minutes seems too short to get anything meaningful done.
        I think for me sitting in an uncomfortable chair is a good way to make sure I take regular mini breaks.
        I am quite sensitive to sound so an alarm throws me too much I think.
      </p>
      <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
      <p>
        I think just accepting my natural rhythms was the most useful piece of advice in the resources.
        I think we spend too much energy fighting with ourselves (and then needing to self medicate to survive).
        Being in tune with yourself is the best way to be.
      </p>
      <h4>Which will you experiment with further?</h4>
      <p>
        I will experiment more with starting small.
        I, like most people, intimidate myself by trying to make too much progress at once.
        By planning to make little changes each day (e.g. typing for half an hour every working morning at 9am) is a good way to tackle the things I am scared of.
