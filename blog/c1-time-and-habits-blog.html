    <h1>Time and Habit Management</h1>
    <h2>12 July 2017</h2>

    <p>
    The timebox and habits techniques I tried were using toggle and the pomodoro technique. I also really liked the blog post about
    counterintuitive ways to be productive. I am very much a seasons girl - I have had times of great productivity but then I have needed to take time out to reboot.
    In saying that I am very organised and committed - necessity is often a great motivator so knowing I have a heap of work due helps me stay productive.
    I also use a series of planning notepads that I refresh on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

      I found the pomodoro technique interesting. 25 minutes seems too short to get anything meaningful done. I think for me sitting in an uncomfortable chair is
      a good way to make sure I take regular mini breaks. I am quite sensitive to sound so an alarm throws me too much I think.

    I think just accepting my natural rhythms was the most useful piece of advice in the resources. I think we spend too much energy fighting with ourselves (and then needing to self medicate to survive).
    Being in tune with yourself is the best way to be.

    I will experiment more with starting small. I, like most people, intimidate myself by trying to make too much progress at once.
    By planning to make little changes each day (e.g. typing for half an hour every working morning at 9am) is a good way to tackle the things I am scared of.
