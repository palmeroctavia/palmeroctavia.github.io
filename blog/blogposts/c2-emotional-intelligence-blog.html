      <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is about interpersonal and intrapersonal skill sets that are able to be improved through practice.
        The practice of EQ involves being:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <div class=body-lists> aware of your emotions;</div></li>
          <li><div class=body-lists>mindful about yourself and surroundings;</div></li>
          <li><div class=body-lists>recognising and understanding your physical responses to emotions; and</div></li>
          <li><div class=body-lists>giving yourself space and strategies to act rather than react based on your emotions.</div></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Improving your EQ helps foster happiness and professional/social success.
        The quote that resonated most with me was - <em>'between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and happiness.'</em>
        I think Viktor Frankl, the man who said it, summarised it so well.
        There are many things in this world that we can not control but we have the ability to choose how we respond.
        Compassion also seemed like the key concept underlying EQ.
        By this I mean that the skills that make up EQ are about the active practice of compassion, with yourself and others.
        If you come to life with this mindset you will have greater motivation to take the high road in your actions.

      <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed just being for the first minute.
        I did it while on the bus between Petone and Dev Academy.
        I focused on my breathing and realised that I was breathing a bit faster in the second minute.
        This is because I was nervous about coming into Dev Academy for the first time.
        My emotion of nervousness meant that my shoulders were raised and that my neck hurt.
        It helped being aware of it because I was able to mother myself a bit.
        I told myself 'Everyone feels nerves when they do something for the first time. You are not alone in this.'
        Then I remembered all the other times that I felt nervous about going to a new place and meeting new people and that almost 99% of the time it went well and I enjoyed myself.
