    The EDA experience is similar to a few experiences I've had before. 
    I don't know if it's luck or destiny but I have always had inspiring educational experiences at cross roads in my life. 
    For example, I had a design teacher in high school who taught in a similar way as EDA, we as learners had responsibility over our learning journey and she guided us when we needed a nudge. 
    EDA has a similar feel, the learning journey is mine individually and collectively. What I do doesn't just effect me but also my cohort. 
    Personally this matches my worldview, we are all essentially alone in this life journey but relationships and collective ties are what keep us thethered to purpose, meaning and strength.

    My impressions are that this cohort are all here to pursue passions and learn the tools to make these passions a way to earn a living. I really liked how people in the orientation session on Monday shared that they love gaming and marvel.
    Life should be fun and I feel like this course will be fun (not in an easy sense) but in a way that carries us all to a place of fulfilment.

      I see myself thriving in the collective spirit and goal. I suit autonomy, I have always felt most content and purposeful when I am doing something challenging, for the common good and something that allows me to problem solve.

    My expectations haven't really changed. I knew the culture fit how I work and that learning so much content in a short space of time would be a challenge.
    I think the thing that has intrigued me is how it feels to be in a cohort of mostly males. It is a different energy to what I am used to and so I think it will take some adjusting to.

    I am super excited to participate in this learning environment. It makes me nervous in a butterflies in stomach way rather than dread though. 
    I think this a journey that I have much to learn from and to give back as well.
