            <h4> How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild? </h4>
            <p>
              It just made me be more at peace with the fact that I am learning a lot and really cementing my knowledge with the process even if the product isn't ideal.
            </p>
            <h4> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
            <p>
              I was already an occasional practitioner of meditation before reading this chapter but my focus had been guided meditations.
              I had never really considered doing completely silent and relatively unstructured meditation before reading this chapter.
            </p>
            <h4> What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
            <p>
              I already knew it was hugely beneficial in many areas of life but I had never thought of it as a way to practice delaying your responses to stimuli.
              This is a really helpful insight for me as it gives me a new thing to focus on while I meditate.
            </p>
            <h4> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
            <p>
              I found the unstructured "focus on your breath" type of meditation very different to what I usually do.
              I actually found it helpful to not be distracted by music or guiding words and just to listen to myself and my body.
            </p>
            <h4> Any other musings?</h4>
            <p>
              Not really, been meditating more this week and have found it really useful for managing stress.
