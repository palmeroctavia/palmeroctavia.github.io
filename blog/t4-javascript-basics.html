            <h4>  How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
            <p>
              Javascript (JS) compares to HTML and CSS in that JS makes webpage content housed in HTML and styled by CSS interactive.

            <h4> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'? </h4>
            <p>
              Control flow refers to making decisions with code and loops is an instruction to the computer to repeat running a block of code a certain number of times or until a condition is met.
              To use an anlogy control flow is like deciding how you will approach drying the laundry, for example if it is sunny you will hang wet clothes up on the line while if it is cold and raining you might use a dryer instead.
              Loops would be like, to use the previous analogy, to keep doing loads of laundry until the laundry basket is empty.
            </p>
            <h4> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </h4>
            <p>
              Accessing data from an array is selecting an item from a list depending on the position of the item in the list/array.
              Accessing data from objects on the other hand is like accessing the properties (description/method) of an object e.g. using a real world example, a cup (a object) could have the associated properties: large, small, tall, white blue, etc.
            </p>
            <h4> Explain what functions are and why they are useful? </h4>
            <p>
              Functions are an instruction to a computer to perform a task.
              Functions can be useful in many instances including counting up objects or making elements appear and disappear as wanted.
