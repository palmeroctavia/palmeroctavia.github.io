            <h4> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you: got blocked on a simple problem and solved a problem in an elegant way.</h4>
            <p>
              Blocked on a simple problem:
               What was the problem? I couldn't get the code to work in a tutorial for Javascript. Turns out I hadn't used the correct syntax.
               What problem solving techniques did you use? I used 'reading error messages' as my technique.
               How did you feel throughout the process? I felt it was very efficient because I just googled the error message and a slack conversation (a message board for web developers) had the solution.
               What did you learn? Error messages are your friend because they give you a quick and specific diagnosis.
               Elegant solution:
               What was the problem? I wanted to display my images on my blog index page in three columns with space between them.
               What problem solving techniques did you use? I googled it at first but that didn't really help because my situation was complicated by the fact that I was using additional code called a framework.
               I then just started playing around.
               How did you feel throughout the process? Very fustrated because I couldn't find the answers I was looking for.
               What did you learn? If all else fails just play and save each iteration with the version control system.
            </p>
            <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>
            <p>
              Pseudocode - Not very confident.
              Trying something - Pretty confident - has worked well in tandem with other approaches.
              Rubber ducky method - not that great.
              Reading error messages - Pretty confident - has worked well in tandem with other approaches.
              Console.logging - Love this approach in theory, haven't used in practice.
              Googling - This is my favourite technique because I'm a researcher at heart.
              Asking your peers for help - Callan has been super helpful throughout this course so I can say I feel pretty confident asking him.
              Asking coaches for help - Not so much because I feel like I am wasting their time.
              Improving your process with reflection - This is a smart strategy in all areas of life, no point completing an activity if you don't learn from it and can't apply the lessons in the future.

            <h4> Explain the following JavaScript array properties to a non-tech friend.</h4>
            <p>
              .map() - Creates a new list of items based on transforming the contents of an old list.
              .filter() - Creates a new list of items after items on a previous list have either been evaluated as fufilling the inclusion requirement for the new list or not.
              .reduce() - Reduces each item in a list into a single item based on a specified requirement.
